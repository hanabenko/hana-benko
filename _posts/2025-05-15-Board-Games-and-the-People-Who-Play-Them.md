description: Playing board games with different people has taught me that how we play says as much about us as why we play.

I love board games. I didn’t realize how personal board games were until I started playing them with people outside my family. Growing up, game night was a regular thing—almost like a family tradition we didn’t talk about, just did. We’d break out the same games again and again, and over time, they became something more than games. They became part of our rhythm.

I noticed this for the first time with Uno. Not because of the cards themselves, but because of how differently people play it. In my family, we’ve always played the way I thought everyone did: if you have multiple cards of the same number, you can drop them all at once. It speeds up the game and adds some surprise. But when I tried that with my college friends, they were completely caught off guard, and all I heard was, “Wait, what are you doing? You can’t play all of those at once! One at a time!”. For them, it was one card per turn, always.

It was such a small rule, but it opened up something big for me. I started realizing that every group has their own version of what’s “normal.” I thought the way I played Uno was universal, but it wasn’t. And that little difference made me wonder: how many other quiet assumptions had I made, not just about games, but about people?

That question kept coming up the more I played with different groups.

Catan is a great example. I’ve played Catan with my family for probably seven years. At this point, we don’t get too intense about it. We’ve figured out our strategies, and we know each other’s habits. The game is chill. We’ll still trade, still compete, but it’s relaxed—no one’s flipping the board over a wheat shortage.

But when I play with friends, it’s completely different. People are suspicious. They’re competitive in a way that’s kind of thrilling, kind of stressful. Someone will form an alliance just to block a longest road, or refuse to trade just to slow someone else down. There’s betrayal, clever negotiation, secret deals. It feels like a completely different game. And it’s not bad, just new and different.

That difference says something about our group dynamics. My family has had years to settle into a kind of unspoken agreement: we play to enjoy each other’s company. We don’t need to win to feel satisfied. With friends, especially when the group is new or still figuring itself out, the game becomes a way to test things. Who’s bold? Who’s cautious? Who holds a grudge over getting robbed twice in a row? In a way, the tension isn’t a problem, it’s just a reflection of where we are in the relationship. Games give us a place to explore that.

That’s part of what makes board games so fascinating to me. They’re like tiny social experiments. And they reveal more than just who’s good at logic or luck. They show us how we communicate, how we handle conflict, and how we express creativity.

Take something like Codenames. My family has played it so many times that we’ve accidentally developed our own system. We’ll say something like “corners 3” or “diagonal 5”, essentially a geographic clue that takes advantage of the same 5x5 map each round, and immediately everyone knows to check the outer edge of the board or the same diagonal. That kind of shared language doesn’t happen overnight; it’s built over dozens of games, where you start to recognize each other’s patterns and ways of thinking. But when I played the same game with my college friends and said “diagonal,” they just looked confused and started looking for diagonal clues in the pictures. Of course they did: it meant nothing to them.

That moment hit me harder than I expected. It made me realize how much of my family’s way of playing is wrapped up in inside jokes and shared context. It’s one of those things you don’t really notice until you’re somewhere else. I wouldn’t say it made me sad exactly, but it made me _aware_. Aware of the little things that make a group feel like home.

What I’ve come to appreciate is how adaptable games are. The same board, the same rules, and a completely different experience depending on who you’re playing with. Some people treat games as puzzles to solve, others treat them like performances, and others see them as a space for connection. None of those are wrong. They’re just different styles, different values coming through.

Even things that used to frustrate me, like when people bend the rules or try to make their own, I see a little differently now. It’s easy to feel annoyed when someone stretches a rule you thought was set in stone. But more often than not, it’s not about cheating the system or doing anything to win. It’s just that they learned a different way to play. Or maybe they want to keep the game moving. Or maybe they’re just trying to level the playing field because they’re new and nervous. There’s usually more going on than it seems.

Over time, I’ve learned to ask questions before we even start: “What rules do you usually play with?” “Is this a competitive round or a casual one?” That helps set expectations and avoids those awkward moments where someone makes a move that feels totally out of bounds to the rest of the group.

What I love most, though, is how games bring out parts of people that you might not see otherwise. Like someone who’s super quiet in daily life but turns out to be a ruthless strategist in a game. Or someone who’s usually competitive but decides to help someone else win just for fun. Or someone who’s not very into rules but comes alive when they get to be the game master and explain everything.

Those moments feel _honest_. Unfiltered. They show who people are when they’re not trying to be anything in particular. And I think that’s the real magic of games. They turn an ordinary evening into something shared, something remembered. Whether it’s laughter over a familiar inside joke or the surprise of discovering a friend’s unexpected strategy, games give us a chance to show up a little more fully, both to ourselves and to each other. And maybe that’s what makes them worth coming back to, no matter who’s at the table.
